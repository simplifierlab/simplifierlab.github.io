						<p class="caption">
							Admins of large GitHub organizations kept clamoring for more
							granular control over who has access to and what actions those
							users can take over certain parts of their account.
						</p>
						<p class="caption">
							To simplify access control, GitHub bundles the ability to take
							actions based on roles, i.e., whether you&rsquo;re a member or
							admin. But, in some cases, those role-based permissions were
							either too lax or too restrictive.
						</p>
						<p class="caption">
							Admins imagined a solution where they&rsquo;re able to allow or
							disallow a subset of actions per user for each feature at their
							discretion.

							Role-based permissions are foundational to how GitHub works.

							(cloud and on-prem), the API, and thousands of third-party apps in

							Offering fine-grained discretionary control for every feature,

							that this would also create tremendous backend and UI complexity

						<p class="caption">
							Working closely with the PM, we interviewed admins from large
							organizations (enterprise and open-source) and trawled through
							100+ customer feedback tickets. We knew that we wouldn&rsquo;t be
							able to ship a solution to a highly-complex problem in 4 months so
							we needed to figure out what to ship first to address the problem
							and lay out a vision for incremental improvements over time.
						</p>
						<p class="caption">
							We determined that at the root of the customer problem was
							security, i.e., enabling users in an organization to have just
							enough permissions to do their job &mdash; no more and no less.
							Addressing the biggest security pain points defined our North Star
							&mdash; not contract value or number of requests.
						</p>

						<h4 class="eyebrow">What to build first</h4>

						<p class="caption">
							We identified a few themes and converged on two (we called them
							<code>Read +</code> and <code>Write +</code>) on both ends of the
							permissions spectrum (see fig. 1) to offer balanced end-to-end
							coverage and help address overly-permissive access controls that
							admins have pointed out in a number of cases.

							<!-- I mapped data from our interviews and created
							provisional personas to help us understand and empathize with
							whose needs admins need to satisfy with sufficient access. -->

						<h4 class="eyebrow">Design sprints</h4>

						<p class="caption">
							For the next 6 weeks, we conducted iterative design sprints where
							I&rsquo;d put together a mockup (or two), write a quick research
							plan outlining the things we want to learn, conduct 5&ndash;7
							customer interview sessions, then use learnings from those
							sessions to inform the next iteration round. A sprint typically
							spanned 5&ndash;7 days.

						<h4 class="eyebrow">Working with our design system</h4>

						<p class="caption">
							Using our design system,
							<a
								href="https://primer.style"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer"
								>Primer</a
							>
							, I was able to create mockups quickly and even prototype in code.
							It&rsquo;s well-documented, has practical CSS utilities, and rich
							component and style libraries for Figma, React, and Rails.
						</p>
						<h4 class="eyebrow">Design iteration highlights</h4>
						<p class="caption">
							Iteration N° 1&ndash;9 (see fig. 2) were more divergent, intended
							to help us explore directions while testing our riskiest
							assumptions about the concept model:
						</p>
						<ul class="caption">
							<li>
								What is their mental model for assigning permissions? Can we
								convey the idea of assigning permissions in a more elegant way
								than the
								<code>chmod</code>-like checkboxes?
							</li>
							<li>
								Does the feature provide value? Is this immediately applicable
								to someone in their org (or outside)?
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="caption">
							By iteration N° 10, we converged toward using verbs
							&ldquo;Triage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maintain&rdquo; instead of
							<code>Read +</code> and <code>Write +</code> to describe the new
							permission roles. Verbs made it easier for users to infer what
							additional permissions were associated with it. Iteration N° 12
							(below) was released as the beta version
							<a
								href="https://github.blog/changelog/2019-05-23-triage-and-maintain-roles-beta/"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer"
								>officially announced</a
							>
							at GitHub Satellite. With iteration N° 13, I begin to lay the
							groundwork for the next version: custom permissions.

							We received nearly 1k sign-ups for Early Access (beta) &mdash;
							about 500 during the first 48 hours alone &mdash; double what we
							expected in the first 2 weeks. We saw high adoption of at least
							one of the new roles among our qualified Early Access users and
							continued to monitor and gather feedback throughout the remainder
							of the beta period and beyond.
