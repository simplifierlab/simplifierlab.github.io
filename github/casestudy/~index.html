							Admins of large GitHub organizations kept clamoring for more
							granular control over who has access to and what actions those
							users can take over certain parts of their account.
						</p>
						<p class="caption">
							To simplify access control, GitHub bundles the ability to take
							actions based on roles, i.e., whether you&rsquo;re a member or
							admin. But, in some cases, those role-based permissions were
							either too lax or too restrictive.
						</p>
						<p class="caption">
							Admins imagined a solution where they&rsquo;re able to allow or

							Role-based permissions are foundational to how GitHub works.

							(cloud and on-prem), the API, and thousands of third-party apps in

						<p class="caption">
							Offering fine-grained discretionary control for every feature,

							especially given the scale of their organizations. Not to mention
							that this would also create tremendous backend and UI complexity
							for us.

							<a

						<h3 class="bar-top">Product strategy</h3>

						<p class="caption">
							Working closely with the PM, we interviewed admins of large GitHub
							organizations (enterprise and open-source) and trawled through
							100+ customer feedback tickets. We knew it was unrealistic to
							expect a complete solution for a highly-complex problem in 4
							months so we set to figure out what to ship first to remedy the
							proverbial &ldquo;Pareto 80%&rdquo; of the problem and lay out a
							vision for incremental improvements over time.
						</p>

						<h4 class="eyebrow">
							Aligning product principles to the root cause
						</h4>

						<p class="caption">
							We determined that at the root of the customer problem was
							security, i.e., enabling users in an organization to have just
							enough permissions to do their job &mdash; no more and no less.
							Addressing the biggest security pain points defined our North Star
							&mdash; not contract value or number of requests. From this, we
							established a key product principle (and best practice) would be
							to err on the side of being more restrictive. It&rsquo;s easier to
							add more permissions later than to take them away.
						</p>

						<h4 class="eyebrow">Mapping access needs to shape proto-personas</h4>
						<p class="caption">
							I cleaned up and mapped data from our interviews which I then used
							to create provisional personas. I applied the jobs-to-done
							framework to translate their needs into discrete, sufficient
							permissions needed in order for them to be effective. Not only did
							these proto-personas help us visualize permission levels that
							underlie each request, they allowed us to have deeper empathy for
							their motivations.

						<h4 class="eyebrow">What to build first</h4>

						<p class="caption">
							We identified a few themes emerge from data mapping and settled on
							two (initially, we referred to them as
							<code>Read +</code> and <code>Write +</code>) on both ends of the
							permissions spectrum (see fig. 1) to offer better end-to-end
							coverage and help address overly-permissive access controls that
							admins have pointed out in conversations.

						<h4 class="eyebrow">Design sprints</h4>

						<p class="caption">
							For the next few weeks, we conducted iterative design sprints
							where I&rsquo;d put together a mockup (or two), write a quick
							research plan outlining the things we want to learn, conduct
							5&ndash;7 customer interview sessions, then use learnings from
							those sessions to inform the next iteration round.
						</p>
						<h4 class="eyebrow">Working with our design system</h4>

						<p class="caption">
							Using our design system,
							<a
								href="https://primer.style"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer"
								>Primer</a
							>
							, I was able to create mockups quickly and even prototype in code.
							It&rsquo;s well-documented, has practical CSS utilities, and rich
							component and style libraries for Figma, React, and Rails.
						</p>
						<h4 class="eyebrow">Design iteration highlights</h4>
						<p class="caption">
							Iteration N° 1&ndash;9 (see fig. 2) were more divergent, intended
							to help us explore directions while testing our riskiest
							assumptions about the concept model:
						</p>
						<ul class="caption">
							<li>
								What is their mental model for assigning permissions? Can we
								convey the idea of assigning permissions in a more elegant way
								than the
								<code>chmod</code>-like checkboxes?
							</li>
							<li>
								Does the feature provide value? Is this immediately applicable
								to someone in their org (or outside)?
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="caption">
							By iteration N° 10, we converged toward using verbs
							&ldquo;Triage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maintain&rdquo; instead of
							<code>Read +</code> and <code>Write +</code> to describe the new
							permission roles. Verbs made it easier for users to infer what
							additional permissions were associated with it. Iteration N° 12
							(below) was released as the beta version
							<a
								href="https://github.blog/changelog/2019-05-23-triage-and-maintain-roles-beta/"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer"
								>officially announced</a
							>
							at GitHub Satellite. With iteration N° 13, I begin to lay the
							groundwork for the next version: custom permissions.

						<p class="caption">
							We received nearly 5k sign-ups for Early Access (beta) &mdash;
							about 3k during the first 48 hours alone &mdash; more than double
							what we expected within the first 2 weeks. We saw high adoption of
							at least one of the new roles among our qualified Early Access
							users and continued to monitor and gather feedback throughout the
							remainder of the beta period.
