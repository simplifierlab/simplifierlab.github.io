							<h3>The vision</h3>
							<p>
								Since the process to become a US citizen was largely paper-based
								and fragmented, USCIS believed that a unified, web application
								would help reduce errors and cut processing times by reconciling
								disparate, analog-based records while also offering applicants
								timely feedback on their application status.
							</p>
							<h3>My role</h3>
							<p>
								On my first day at 18F, I was dispatched to join the USCIS
								engagement. For the past year, the 18F team had already been at
								work on the digital transformation of the Application for
								Citizenship (N-400). I took over as the Engagement Lead for the
								PM who was about to go on maternity leave.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>The team</h3>
							<p>
								The 18F design team included 2 UX designers, 2 content
								designers, and a visual designer. They reportedly had a tough
								relationship with the USCIS partners. With 5 months left on the
								engagement, I was entrusted with ensuring we deliver on
								expectations and landing the project on good terms. It’s
								probably worth mentioning that, other than being an immigrant
								myself, I don't have a background in immigration or any prior
								experience in government.

					<h2>User insights, finally</h2>
					<p class="lede">
						By the time I joined the team, the application was already in
						engineering yet had never been validated with users. I urged our
						USCIS partners to let us conduct user interviews. Structured in the
						guise of a usability test, we developed a research plan to also help
						us validate mission-critical assumptions about the primary target
						users and assess whether the web app would be useful.
					</p>

					<details>
						The answer varied depending on who I asked. We eventually settled on
						a working hypothesis that our primary target users &mdash; i.e.,
						early adopters &mdash; are highly tech-savvy and are comfortable
						with highly-sensitive online transactions.

					<details>
						Recruiting research participants is never easy. Finding
						naturalization applicants was even more so because we had to walk a
						fine line of a few federal protocols &mdash; including murky
						guidance on
						<a

						implications and offering incentives. Along with our USCIS partners,
						we obtained clearance and completed 33 intercept interviews in situ
						in Chicago, New York, and San Francisco USCIS field offices over an
						8-week span. We selected those locations because they had the
						best-fitting, demographically representative samples of N400
						applicants.

						Among the tech-savvy participants, we found that most were unlikely
						to use the app and file on their own, opting instead to hire
						professional services to file on their behalf. Of the remaining
						participants, access to desktop technology and insufficient guidance and
						transparency into the journey ahead created barriers that made the
						existing PDFs the preferable option.
