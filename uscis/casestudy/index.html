							<h3>The vision</h3>
							<p>
								Since the process to become a US citizen was largely paper-based
								and fragmented, USCIS believed that a unified, web application
								would help reduce errors and cut processing times by reconciling
								disparate, analog-based records while also offering applicants
								timely feedback on their application status.
							</p>
							<h3>My role</h3>
							<p>
								On my first day at 18F, I was dispatched to join the USCIS
								engagement. For the past year, the 18F team had already been at
								work on the digital transformation of the Application for
								Citizenship (N-400). I took over as the Engagement Lead for the
								PM who was about to go on maternity leave.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>The team</h3>
							<p>
								The 18F design team included 2 UX designers, 2 content
								designers, and a visual designer. They reportedly had a tough
								relationship with the USCIS partners. With 5 months left on the
								engagement, I was entrusted with ensuring we deliver on
								expectations and landing the project on good terms. It’s
								probably worth mentioning that, other than being an immigrant
								myself, I don't have a background in immigration or any prior
								experience in government.

					<h2>User insights, finally</h2>
					<p class="lede">
						By the time I joined the team, the application was already in
						engineering yet had never been validated with users. I urged our
						USCIS partners to let us conduct user interviews. Structured in the
						guise of a usability test, we developed a research plan to also help
						us validate mission-critical assumptions about the primary target
						users and whether the web app would be useful.
					</p>
					<h3>Research participants</h3>
					<div class="content-2col">
						<p>
							Recruiting research participants is never easy. Finding
							naturalization applicants was even more so because of a lot of federal protocols including murky guidance on
							<a

							>

							implications and offering incentives. With the help of our USCIS
							partners, we managed to obtain clearance and conducted 33
							intercept interviews in situ in Chicago, New York, and San
							Francisco USCIS field offices over an 8-week period. We selected
							those locations in particular because they had the best
							demographically-representative samples of N400 applicants.
