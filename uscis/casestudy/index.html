					The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)

					in rethinking immigration services. But, with mounting pain points and
					unending opportunities for improvement, turns out, the trickiest
					challenge was aligning on priorities and pivoting on product strategy.

						<span>The brief:</span> Enable online applications for US
						citizenship
					</h2>
					<div class="content-2col">
						<div>
							<h3>The vision</h3>
							<p>
								Since the process to become a US citizen was largely paper-based
								and fragmented, USCIS believed that a unified, web application
								would help reduce errors and cut processing times by reconciling
								disparate, analog-based records while also offering applicants
								timely feedback on their application status.
							</p>
							<h3>My role</h3>
							<p>
								On my first day at 18F, I was immediately deployed to join the
								USCIS engagement. For the past year, the 18F team had been
								tasked with the digital transformation of the Application for
								Citizenship (N-400). I took over as the Engagement Lead for the
								PM who was about to go on maternity leave.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>The team</h3>
							<p>
								The 18F design team included 2 UX designers, 2 content
								designers, and a visual designer. They had a tense relationship
								with the USCIS partners. With 5 months left on the engagement, I
								was entrusted with ensuring we deliver on expectations and land
								the project on good terms. It’s probably worth mentioning that,
								aside from being an immigrant myself, I’m no immigration expert
								nor did I have any prior experience in government.

					<h2>User insights, finally</h2>
					<p class="lede">
						Since the online application was already in development but hadn’t
						yet been validated with users, I urged our USCIS partners to let us
						conduct user interviews. Structured in the guise of a usability
						test, we developed a research plan to also help us validate
						mission-critical assumptions about the primary target users and
						whether the web app would be useful.
