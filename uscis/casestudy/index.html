				<h1>USCIS <span class="subtitle">Case study</span></h1>

				<p class="lede">
					On the heels of the much-improved relaunch of Healthcare.gov, a number
					of federal agencies wanted to follow suit and adopt a human-centered
					approach to designing public services. Accordingly, the United States
					Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approached
					<a
						href="https://18f.gsa.gov"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>18F</a
					>
					to help them modernize immigration services. But with a mountain of
					pain points and unending opportunities for improvement, turns out, the
					trickiest challenge was aligning on priorities and pivoting on product
					strategy.

						The brief: Enable qualified non-citizens to apply for US citizenship
						online

					<div class="content-2col">

							<h3>The vision</h3>
							<p>
								On my first day at 18F, I was immediately deployed to join the
								USCIS engagement team who, for the past year, had been tasked
								with the digital transformation of the Application for
								Citizenship (N-400).
							</p>
							<p>
								Since the application process was largely paper-based and
								fragmented, the belief was that
								<span class=""
									>a unified, digital online application would help reduce
									errors and cut processing times</span
								>
								by reconciling disparate, analog-based records while also
								<span class=""
									>offering applicants timely feedback into their application
									status</span
								>.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>The team</h3>
							<p>
								I took over as the Engagement Lead for the PM who was about to
								go on maternity leave. The 18F design team included 2 UX
								designers, 2 content designers, and a visual designer.
							</p>
							<p>
								The 18F team reportedly had a tense relationship with the USCIS
								partners. With 5 months left on the engagement, I was entrusted
								with ensuring we deliver on expectations and land the project on
								good terms. It’s probably worth mentioning that, aside from
								being an immigrant myself, I’m no immigration expert nor did I
								have any prior experience in government.

					<h2>User insights, finally</h2>
					<p class="lede">
						Since the online application was already in development but hadn’t
						yet been validated with users, I urged our USCIS partners to let us
						conduct user interviews. Structured in the guise of a usability
						test, we developed a research plan to also help us validate
						mission-critical assumptions about the primary target users and
						whether the web app would be useful.
