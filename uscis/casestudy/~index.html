								<h3>The vision</h3>
								<p>
									Since the process to become a US citizen was largely
									paper-based and fragmented, USCIS believed that a unified, web
									application would help reduce errors and cut processing times
									by reconciling disparate, analog-based records while also
									offering applicants timely feedback on their application
									status.
								</p>
							</article>
							<article
								data-aos="fade-up"
								data-aos-delay="500"
								class="aos-init aos-animate"
							>
								<h3>My role</h3>
								<p>
									On my first day at 18F, I was dispatched to join the USCIS
									engagement with 5 months remaining in the contract. For the
									past year, the 18F team had already been at work on the
									digital transformation of the Application for Citizenship
									(N-400). I took over as the Engagement Lead for the PM who was
									about to go on maternity leave.

								<h3>The team</h3>
								<p>
									The 18F design team included 2 UX designers, 2 content
									designers, and a visual designer. They reportedly had a tough
									relationship with the USCIS partners. With 5 months left on
									the engagement, I was entrusted with ensuring we deliver on
									expectations and landing the project on good terms. It&rsquo;s
									probably worth mentioning that, other than being an immigrant
									myself, I don't have a background in immigration or any prior
									experience in government.

					<h2>User insights, finally</h2>
					<p class="lede">
						By the time I joined the team, the engineers were already building
						the application but hadn&rsquo;t validated anything with users. I
						urged our USCIS partners to let us conduct user interviews.
						Structured in the guise of a usability test, we developed a research
						plan to also help us validate mission-critical assumptions about the
						primary target users and assess whether the web app would be useful.
					</p>

					<details>
						The answer varied depending on who I asked which, on its own,
						indicated a lack of deep understanding of who they're designing for.
						We eventually settled on a working hypothesis that our primary
						target users &mdash; i.e., early adopters &mdash; are highly
						tech-savvy and are used to conducting highly-sensitive online
						transactions.

						<summary>Who&rsquo;s the primary target user?</summary>
					</details>

					<details>
						Recruiting research participants is never easy. Finding
						naturalization applicants was even more so because we had to walk
						the fine line of federal protocols &mdash; including murky guidance
						on
						<a

						>

						implications and offering incentives. Along with our USCIS partners,
						we obtained clearance and completed 33 intercept interviews in situ
						in Chicago, New York, and San Francisco USCIS field offices over an
						8-week span. We selected those locations because they had the
						best-fitting, demographically representative samples of N400
						applicants.
