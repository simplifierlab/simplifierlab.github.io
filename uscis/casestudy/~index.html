						<span>The brief:</span> Enable online applications for US
						citizenship
					</h2>
					<div class="content-2col">
						<div>
							<h3>The vision</h3>
							<p>
								Since the process to become a US citizen was largely paper-based
								and fragmented, USCIS believed that a unified, web application
								would help reduce errors and cut processing times by reconciling
								disparate, analog-based records while also offering applicants
								timely feedback on their application status.
							</p>
							<h3>My role</h3>
							<p>
								On my first day at 18F, I was dispatched to join the USCIS
								engagement. For the past year, the 18F team had already been at
								work on the digital transformation of the Application for
								Citizenship (N-400). I took over as the Engagement Lead for the
								PM who was about to go on maternity leave.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>The team</h3>
							<p>
								The 18F design team included 2 UX designers, 2 content
								designers, and a visual designer. They reportedly had a tough
								relationship with the USCIS partners. With 5 months left on the
								engagement, I was entrusted with ensuring we deliver on
								expectations and landing the project on good terms. It’s
								probably worth mentioning that, other than being an immigrant
								myself, I don't have a background in immigration or any prior
								experience in government.

					<h2>User insights, finally</h2>
					<p class="lede">
						By the time I joined the team, the application was already in
						engineering yet had never been validated with users. I urged our
						USCIS partners to let us conduct user interviews. Structured in the
						guise of a usability test, we developed a research plan to also help
						us validate mission-critical assumptions about the primary target
						users and assess whether the web app would be useful.
					</p>

					<details>
						The answer varied depending on who I asked which, on its own,
						indicated a lack of deep understanding of who they're designing for.
						We eventually settled on a working hypothesis that our primary
						target users &mdash; i.e., early adopters &mdash; are highly
						tech-savvy and are used to conducting highly-sensitive online
						transactions.

						<summary>Who’s the primary target user?</summary>
					</details>

					<details>
						Recruiting research participants is never easy. Finding
						naturalization applicants was even more so because we had to walk
						the fine line of federal protocols &mdash; including murky guidance
						on
						<a

						>

						implications and offering incentives. Along with our USCIS partners,
						we obtained clearance and completed 33 intercept interviews in situ
						in Chicago, New York, and San Francisco USCIS field offices over an
						8-week span. We selected those locations because they had the
						best-fitting, demographically representative samples of N400
						applicants.
